Implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Python Natural Language Processing (NLP) is so easy

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is simple yet powerful technique useful for information extraction from text documents.

Wikipedia defines NER as follows:
Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
